                        These results have proven to me that my self-perception is reasonably on point. The clearest results being that I am a very practical, hands on person, that is observant and supportive of other people. Problem solving, persistence and openness also are factors I have always seen in myself. One of the key downsides are that I am a little introverted, although I like to see myself as being comfortable around new people, however social anxiety and insecurity plays into that greatly. The other downside is that I take on too much myself, being altruistic and tend to overload myself not just with work, but repressed emotions. These results combined make it very clear that I like to put others ahead of myself.

                        <i>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</i>
                        <br>
                        <br>  
                        The most influential factor to teamwork that these results have shown is my introversion. I am probably too careful and cautious coming into a new group with new people. However, I feel that once a relationship is established, I can overcome this issue and it should not affect the team. My other concern is that my altruism may lead me to taking on too much work without looking for assistance from my team. This then will lead to heightened stress and potentially a reduction in the quality of my work. Besides these factors, I feel I will be an open, honest, and hard-working team member who likes to discuss ideas and problem solve. 
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        <i>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</i>
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        Two factors come to mind when considering the perfect team for myself. How introverted everyone else is, and how unmotivated they are. These two factors will probably cause not just my own but the teams work to lack quality and effort. I like to imagine that in the case that there are more introverted teammates, I can usually artificially extrovert myself for the purposes of helping others come out of their shells. However, I feel that I will not be able to motivate and inspire others as much as I would like to. My position in the team would not necessarily be a leader, but potentially the strongest link, making sure that the work is being done and that problems are being solved. With an inspiring and creative leader, the team would most likely be a success.
