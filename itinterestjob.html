                    IT has been an interest for me from a very young age. I would be given old broken computers and printers from family friends and I would tear them down. Not knowing what I was actually doing, I just enjoyed getting hands on with various devices. This eventually developed into actual attempts at fixing devices as I got into my teens, which in most cases was successful. Eventually I developed enough knowledge to start building custom computers, speakers, and doing all sorts of repairs for family and friends. Besides interest in hardware, I also developed an interest for front-end web development. One of my first jobs was for an online cigar business. Through skills I learnt with developing Tumblr blogs, I used these skills to assist in maintaining the website of the business. I then went to do my Diploma of Electrical and Communication Engineering, which led me into university. There I changed directions, and after two years realised that I need to return to my real passion, IT.

                    <i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I chose to come to RMIT for a couple key reasons. Firstly, I was not happy with the direction I had chosen at the University of Queensland. I wanted to change degrees and also move onto an online platform. The reason being that I did not like wasting my time and money having to travel into campus, and found that I could manage my own time better studying from home after finishing a Diploma in Web Design. The other reason is a little more political and simply put, I did not want to support UQ with what has been currently unfolding. I chose RMIT because I deemed it to be the best university offering this type of degree, purely online.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The most important thing for me, is to find my niche. I have had very broad experience with many fields of IT, and seem to enjoy most, if not all of them. I want to narrow down my passion, and to find my dream, life-long career. If along the way I learn and develop other skills, then that is just icing on the cake.
